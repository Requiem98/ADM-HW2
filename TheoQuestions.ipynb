    "On the other hand, as long as $\\ n> 1$, we will execute the two recursive calls in which $\\ n $ halves at each call until it becomes $\\ <= 1$ and then we will start to exit the recursive calls. Every time we exit the two recursive calls the \"swapList\" function is executed in which the elements of the array $\\ a$ are swapped. But in order to execute this function correctly, further conditions must be set, otherwise we will have an error and the algorithm will not be executed. We must check that the sum between the integer $\\ n$ and the index $\\ l$ is less than the length of the array $\\ a$, that is $\\ l + n < len(a)$, or (since we are talking about integers) $\\ l + n - 1 <= len(a)$, otherwise when we execute the \"for\" loop the index we are going to replace will be greater than the maximum index of $\\ a$ and the algorithm will stop. This if $\\ n/2$ is included in the range of the \"for\" loop. Otherwise we will have to check that $\\ l + n <= len(a)$ if $\\ n/2$ is not included in the range of the \"for\" loop. Moreover the division $\\ n/2$ must be a division between integers because the indexes of the arrays are integers. Therefore, given these conditions, the function will be executed correctly. So in the end we will have the array $\\ a$ in which the elements have been swapped places. If $\\ n/2$ is included in the range of the \"for\" loop, then the elements of the array $\\ a$ that will be swapped are elements from $\\ a[l]$ to $\\ a[l+n]$, if instead $\\ n/2$ is not included in the range of the \"for\" loop, the elements of $\\ a$ that will be exchanged are the elements from $\\ a[l]$ to $\\ a[l+n-1]$."
